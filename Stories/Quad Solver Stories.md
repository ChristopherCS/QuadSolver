## Quadratic Solver
We will create a quadratic solver for engineers to use whereby, the engineer can provide three 32 bit IEEE single precision floating point numbers as input, and the program will return the respective "x" values which are the solutions for the Quadratic formula. (Quadratic formula being x = -b +- sqrt(b^2 -4ac)/2a)

### Input Prompt and Gathering
The program will propt the user to input 3 32 bit IEEE floating point numbers, and it read user input into the program from the command line. 

### Input Validation
The Program will verify that the input is 3 32 bit IEEE floating point numbers.

### My Square Root
The program will implement it's own square root function which documents/reports every call to the square root function.
