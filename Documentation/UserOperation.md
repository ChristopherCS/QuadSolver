##User Operation
There are two ways for a user to operate this program. The user can either supply the coefficients a, b, and c on the command line, or s/he can enter them during the program once it is running. 

####Command Line
Run the program with the arguments on the command line like this:
./qs <value 1> <value 2> <value 3>

####During Runtime
During runtime, if no arguments are supplied, user will see the following prompt:
Enter the values for A, B, C:
The user just enters three values on the command line and the program will output the result. It should appear like this:
Enter the values for A, B, C: <value 1> <value 2> <value 3>
