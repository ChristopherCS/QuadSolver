Solve the Quadratic Equation.
Call it Quad?

Input looks like:
Input A, B, C: _ _ _ ->(enter)
[Prints Out Result]
x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a : for ax^2+bx+c=0

Input single precision (ieee 32 bit precision, normalized).
Output Single Precision (ieee 32 bit precision, normalized).

Written in Gnu C or R. 
Current Gnu C supports quad precision. 

Runs on linux. 

Look at the Table Makers Dilemma.

Should have a "Standards" Directory with:
Must include a document about version control. 
Must include a programming standard document.
Must include a build tool standard.
Must include a unit testing standard.

Should have a "Legal" Directory with:
Documentation that an NDA is (or is not) required.
Licence File.
Documentation about who "Owns" this file. (only needs to be open source).

Should have a "Stories" Directory with:
A Readme if there are subdirectories, this directory will have many directories.
IEEE FLoating Points
Input Directory
Testing Directory
Spikes Directory 

Should have a SRC directory (where all the source goes)

May have a Build directory.

May have a test directory.



**New Notes from Sep 24, 2018**
Tasks for the Program:
  -> Read an Input String 
  -> Validate Input: Make sure the input string contains a, b, and c as valid single precision input numbers.
     (Watch out for inf, nan, etc.). 
  -> Output String: Output the input parameters
  -> A "my_sqrt" function as a sort of interface to the sqare root function in the c math library.
