Created an Interfaces Definition File. It's a first draft, you guys should probably look at it. But it's a start.

Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/ChristopherCS/QuadSolver



Thu Oct 18 14:41:12 2018 -0400

Created a MakeFile - functional. Crated quadsolver.h - functional (We should put all includes and function prototypes here.). Created mySquareRoot.c with function. Wrote the "solve" function in quadSolver.c which should solve the quadratic equation.



Thu Oct 18 14:44:32 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
Added .gitignore and removed the .vscode folder.

Created logging methods. One Method 'initLogfile' is required at the start of the program to initiate a clean log file. The other method 'logMessage' is passed a string with the message to log. This message is timestamped and logged in the file.



Mon Oct 29 14:52:25 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
Fixed makefile



Mon Oct 29 15:19:01 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
Updated the Version Control Standard



Mon Oct 29 15:36:39 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
Updated the 'solve' function. It now takes two additional arguments, a pointer to an int nRoots and a pointer to a float array of length 2 result. nRoots will be populated by the number of roots found, and the array of length two will be populated with one or two roots upon success.



Tue Oct 30 10:08:59 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
Fixed a bit of logic in the solver program, and I fixed the make file. And I changed a file name, I had misnamed 'mySquareRoot.c' as 'mySqareRoot.c'.



Tue Oct 30 10:33:27 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
Fixed the solve program again. Now we can be sure that the MOST NEGATIVE result will be the first result in results array. This will help with testing.

Added input .c, still working on it.

Setup unit tests for the Validate method. Have not tested the tests yet. Will Do Soon...



Thu Nov 1 14:13:42 2018 -0400
Chris Carlson
The input and verification tests are complete and they run. Currently they do not pass, as expected. Notice that in order to test them you have to run 'make prepTest', then 'make', then './verifyInput'.
